# BioFlow - Transforming Fish Waste into Resources

Welcome to BioFlow, where we harness the potential of fish waste for a sustainable future.

## Project Overview

In the thriving fishing industry, substantial fish waste is generated, including heads, tails, fins, bones, and organs. BioFlow steps in to repurpose this byproduct, unlocking valuable resources rich in nutrients, proteins, and minerals. Our mission is to transform what was once discarded into a catalyst for positive change.

## The Cause

As fish waste accumulates from fishing fleets and processing sectors, BioFlow aims to mitigate environmental impact. By repurposing fish waste, we address the challenges posed by the UN Agenda 14 - Life Below Water, fostering responsible resource utilization and contributing to a cleaner aquatic ecosystem.

## How BioFlow Helps

BioFlow serves as a platform connecting industries that can utilize fish waste. Port suppliers and fish market vendors find a sustainable solution, turning waste into valuable resources. Our initiative promotes responsible consumption and supports the global shift towards a circular economy.
